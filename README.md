The poor man's field bus

Gauge is a cheap and straightforward set of tools for automating things in the world around you. 
The scope of the project includes hardware, firmware, and backend software. 
The primary goal is to make the hardware as cheap as possible and still get the job done. 
An orthogonal goal is to make integrating new sensors and actuators as easy as possible. 
Wireless hardware is expensive. 
Comparitively twisted pair wiring is not. 
The hardware design for gauge makes use of CAN transceivers to move bits from place to place.
